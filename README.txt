Morse Converter

My program is converter, it can convert text to Morse code and Morse code to text,
but it can only convert 26 letters of English alphabet and numbers. 
When user opens program, it’ll momentally ask user to choose whether he wants to ‘encode’ or ‘decode’, so user should type letter e or d.
After typing e user will be asked to enter the text he wants to convert into Morse code,
 when text is typed and user presses Enter button converted text will be shown next line, 
and user is asked again to choose if he wants to decode or encode, this step will be made every time until user types ‘ * ’ symbol to stop the program .
Statistics of entered letters and converted dots and dashes are counter and imported into file called Statistics.
If user types d letter program will ask him to enter Morse text, and it’ll be converted to text, 
same procedure will continuea until user types ‘ * ‘ symbol. 
Statistics are measured here as well and imported to the same file.
